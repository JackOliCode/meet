How will I use serverless functions within my app? 

I will use servless functions in order to authorise users for my app. Specifically, I will use AWS for this and users will send information to AWS and receive a token
back, which will be used to access the app. 


Styling:
I wanted the background of the app to look like a nights sky and hopefully I'll replace the current gradient with an image in the near future. The golds and reds are colors I'd associate with nights out.
